Sudoku-JS

This Sudoku solver combines constraint propagation with backtracker, this method is capable of solving all sudokus and it does most (that I've tested) within a reasonable timespan.

Couldn't really be bothered to get an UI into this repo because this initially was part of P1k and that UI stuff is built upon the Laravel framework with a bunch of stuff backing it.
